Rough transcript
Stuart  
Welcome to Teach Me About the Great Lakes, a podcast in which I get people who are smarter and harder working than I am to teach me about the Great Lakes. My name is Stuart Carlton and I work with Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant and I'm a natural resources social scientist by training. So I know a bunch about people and their behavior, environmental behaviors, how science influences people how to communicate about science, but I don't know much about the Great Lakes. And so we've started this podcast, and with me, as always is Illinois, Indiana. seagrams communications coordinator hope charters hope How's it going?

Hope  
Hey, Stuart. I'm great. How are you?

Stuart  
I'm also doing good. I was at the doctor last night with a back thing. So I'm all hopped up on painkillers and caffeine and ready to roll. Anyway, hope What do you know about the Great Lakes?

Hope  
I know next to nothing, I don't have a science background. And so learning from our specialists is really fun for me.

Stuart  
So one of the things we talked about a lot in Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant is this idea of microplastics and I kind of know what are, but but not really. And so I'm especially excited about the chance to bring in Sarah Zack so that she could teach us all about him. Alright, and we're here today with Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant's Pollution Prevention extension specialist, Sarah Zack, how are you, Sarah?

Sarah  
I'm great. Thank you for having me.

Stuart  
Oh, you're welcome. Thank you for coming on. And Sarah is going to teach us today all about this thing that I keep hearing about, but I don't know a lot about which is micro plastics. This is kind of an emergent contaminant, is that right?

Sarah  
Yeah, you could say that.

Stuart  
So what exactly are I mean, I can sort of figure it out right... micro means small plastic means plastic, I guess. But But what is a microplastic, exactly?

Sarah  
Yeah. So I mean, it is as the name implies, small pieces of plastic. But the technical definition is that these are pieces of plastic that are less than five millimeters in size. So really, really small pieces of plastic.

Stuart  
Yeah, five millimeters. What's that's like? That's like way less than an inch.

Sarah  
it's half a centimeter for those of us on the metric system.

Stuart  
Oh, there we go. Well we know 2.54 centimeters is an inch. So it's very little.

Sarah  
Yes, very little. Yeah. Some of them can't be seen with the naked eye.

Stuart  
Oh, my goodness. Well, my eyes are never naked. Thanks my glasses. The rest of me though, on a regular basis. So where does where do these things come from.

Sarah  
So the source of the sources of microplastics vary depending on what kind of microplastics we're talking about. And there are a variety of different kinds. So there are what are known as primary microplastics, which are things that are created in the form, and those are things like microbeads. Microbeads are the the most widely known example.

Stuart  
Like my face wash?

Sarah  
Yes, yes. And the other type of of B type microplastic is a pellet or — and this is my favorite — they're also called nurdles.

Stuart  
Nurdles. Yeah.

Sarah  
I love going into a room full of people in suits and telling them about nurdles, all about your nurdles. It is, is it's small, round pieces of plastic. Usually they're a little bit bigger than the microbeads. And they're used to mold larger pieces of plastic. So the example I always use is like if you go to the zoo and you see those mold-o-rama things where you can mold an animal or something like that. They're taking nurdles, they're taking these plastic pellets and they're heating them and they're molding them into larger pieces of life. And those things get lost at sea and on trucks really, really often.

Stuart  
So it's kinda like the opposite of the shrinky doing so I think I see no,

Hope  
Have you ever eaten those nerds when your kids...I'm imagining these are basically nerds.

Sarah  
That's great. They're plastic nerds which they might taste the same, I mean, nerds aren't actually the most flavorful of candies. So those are primary microplastics. And then there's also secondary ones. And those are the pieces of bigger pieces of plastic. So little fragments of, of water bottles and small pieces of film that have broken off from larger pieces of film and styrofoam that's broken down into like those little styrofoam pellet or little styrofoam beads. And then fibers that come off of, of clothing and carpets and other things that are made from non-natural fabrics.

Stuart  
Okay, I want to come back to fibers but I'm still focused on microbeads So like an individual microbead breaks down and become microplastics or just when you wash your face or whatever do they just are they you know, as soon as they go into the water stream there, they're microplastics ready to roll?

Sarah  
Yeah, they're microplastics they are made as microplastics and used as microplastics So yeah, we're just pumping them we were for a time there and microbeads are banned now. So, so you don't see them being added to our waters very frequently anymore. But for a time there, we were just kind of pumping out

Stuart  
like literally washing them out into the water.

Sarah  
Yeah, exactly.

Stuart  
So the secondary microplastics...

Sarah  
Those are caused when plastics like break down, or...

Stuart  
How do they break down what causes it?

Sarah  
It's a variety of ways. So it can be, you know, you throw a water bottle... This is a terrible example but you throw a water bottle out onto the street, and it gets run over by a car and breaks up into tiny pieces and washes into the gutter and then ends up in our walkways. Or it can be that our there's larger pieces of plastic out in the environment and and wave action and weather and the sun beating down and things like that can can degrade it and it breaks up into smaller pieces that way so

Stuart  
it is washed out into the water into the lake or the ocean or whatever. And then so well, let's talk about the clothes. So the fiber so when I buy like clothes, how does it I don't understand how does the plastic from the clothes end up in the water? Is it just a brush off of me or is it you know, when it rains? what what what's the mechanism there?

Sarah  
Yeah, so it can be a variety of different ways. You know, just friction, like rubbing your arms as you're walking can shed fibers, fleece, I think are the best example to use because they're essentially made of plastic. I mean, they even advertise a lot of leases as being you know, 75% recycled water bottles and you know, things like that. And the very things that make them good at keeping us warm are also the things that make them shed fibers to so. So yeah, so just friction can do it, you know, walking across the carpet kicks up a lot of, of little fibers. But really, washing machines are a big, big source of these things. Because when you put these non natural fibers in the wash, and they get agitated and they rub against each other, it kicks off a lot of these fibers and then those fibers go into your wastewater and go to wastewater treatment plants.

Stuart  
And they get filtered out there or I guess they don't...

Sarah  
Some of them do. wastewater treatment plants in general are pretty efficient at getting rid of microplastics they settle out into the solids, you know, at pretty high rates. You know, sometimes I think, I think I read a paper once that said that, you know, as many as 99% of the plastics in wastewater get filtered out, but we're talking about trillions and trillions and trillions of fibers. Right.

Stuart  
So some are getting through... are there still a lot of them?

Sarah  
Right? Because it's 1% of just such a huge number.

Stuart  
Exactly, exactly. That reminds me there's a comic. What does it XKCD this kind of nerdy comic they have one where they talk about like the effectiveness of antibacterial hand, hand wash, and it's like 99.9% of bacteria killed. Anyway, I'll put a link to it in the show notes, but it's there's still a lot of bacteria on your hand. Yeah,

Sarah  
that 1.1% is still really huge, right? Yeah.

Stuart  
Yeah. So uh, so then what kind of...you mentioned natural fibers. So microplastics come from a non-natural fibers applicators like polyester, nylon, etc. Is there one that's worse or better? How's that work?

Sarah  
That's a great question. But I don't know the answer to that. The they all just kind of get lumped together because they're all essentially made from plastic. They're all petroleum based. So yeah, polyester and nylon and fleece and lycra and all those things that are not cotton, or linen, or hemp, essentially, there might be others that are natural too. Wool, of course. Those are sort of the the four big ones that are they are also shedding fibers because of friction. It's not unique to not natural clothing, right? Like you're still losing fibers from your cotton t shirts in the washing machine. But because they're made from natural fibers, they naturally break down in the environment in a totally different way.

Stuart  
Yeah. Interesting. Okay, so all these get washed out into the water. And that doesn't sound ideal to tell you the truth. Like do we know what happens to them? Let's just take Lake Michigan, for example. Everybody in Chicago, sheds their microplastics from their polyester or whatever. What happens?

Sarah  
So that's funny that you say that so in Chicago we then push all of those fibers downstream, because we reversed the river. So we send it all down to Peoria. And we said, well, ultimately we send it all down to the Gulf of Mexico, right in the Mississippi River and down. But yeah, I mean, a lot of a lot of places are still using the Great Lakes as you know, water sources, and they're discharging that water into the Great Lakes. And, and what's happening is a lot of these are in the water column, they're moving around, they're getting trapped on the shore, and they're sinking into the sediment. So they're sinking down to the very bottom of the lake and kind of bigger, they're kind of trapped when they're down there. You know, sort of like dredging up all of the bottom material. There really isn't any place for them to go once they end up down in the bottom.

Stuart  
So if they're down in the bottom, do we know that they tend to stay there or you know, do the fish eat them? What happens to them when they're in there? Do we know?

Sarah  
So the, the bulk of them just sort of end up in the sediments and, and in a lot of cases, they just don't get disturbed. There are things that are feeding at that bottom level. But I would say overwhelmingly, the things that end up in the settlements end up staying in the settlements. It's really the stuff that's in the water column. I think that has the most, I don't know, potential for impacts because we don't really know what's going to happen with the stuff that's sitting on the bottom. You know, we can't predict that really, but the stuff that's in the water now we know has a really high potential to affect things. And so there's a lot of research going on to figure out whether that's actually happening or not...

Stuart  
obviously, so when the microplastics get in the water some portion of them go to the sediment, maybe the majority, but not all. And so the ones that are up in the water column, does it look like they're starting to have some sort of effect on the ecology there the food chain, maybe?

Sarah  
so we have Carolyn Foley with us here to right and she did a great study recently looking at this, and I think she could probably offer some good insight into that.

Stuart  
Excellent transition. Sarah. Hi, Carolyn, Carolyn Fole, Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant's research coordinator. How are you today?

Carolyn  
I am doing well. Thank you. And yes, I get to be research coordinator a lot of the time but periodically I get to actually do research, which is fun.

Stuart  
Who watches the watchmen? I'm reading that right now. I just finished it this morning on the bus ride in. So I'm very Watchmen-attuned as we speak. Anyway, also in a bad mood after that, but regardless, so Carolyn, what happens...What do we know about the water column and how do we know it?

Carolyn  
So we know that it's there... We know that plastic is in every part of the water column like Sarah said, in sediments and up in the water column. We know that it's in places where there are tons of things living we know that it's in places where there's no one living. There's plastic absolutely everywhere. We know that organisms consume it. There are a lot of different organisms from zooplankton and rotifers, really tiny things all the way up to big salmon, and birds.

Stuart  
They all consume it directly.

Carolyn  
They can all consume it directly. There are even some studies way back from where the way that researchers are examining whether or not a fish like a normal fish would eat food was by feeding them plastic pellets and like instead of giving them real food they were they were trying to look at like a behavioral thing. And they were feeding them plastic pellets and they were going after them and depending on the organism. Yeah, it's all like way back. But, and this topic has, you know, the idea that organisms might consume microplastic has been around, you know, since the 70s. People have been thinking about it. In the last 10 years or so, there's been a really big effort to try to understand what are the impacts so like, if they're consuming it, what winds up happening?

Hope  
Yeah, I want to know what happens to humans because we eat fish. So if plastics are going into fish, and we eat the fish then are plastics going into us?

Carolyn  
Absolutely. Yes. And there is evidence that the plastic because even if it doesn't translocate to like the fish tissue, of which there is evidence, like they've found plastic microplastics in shellfish that are ready to be consumed by humans and things like that, so like, yeah, I would say almost definitely, there is a chance that if you're eating a fish that there's some plastic in that fish. However, whether or not it's a problem is really like if there's an active debate happening right now, sort of like, because some people have actually postulated that by if plastic goes through, would it maybe leach some other contaminants out onto it because of the chemical properties of the plastic?

Stuart  
Wait, what?

Carolyn  
Yeah, so like there was a study where they looked at fish that were consuming plastic and fish that weren't to see, you know, do they have different contaminant loads in their tissue because the chemical property of the plastic is that the contaminant would potentially be attracted to the plastic and be carried on it. There's not a lot of evidence that that's actually happening, but people are trying to figure it out. And so the plastics, you know, they're not necessarily going to cause direct harm the way that some other contaminants might like, there are contaminants that are toxic that are, you know, going to cause you to die instantly, whereas consuming plastic may just mean that you eat less other food if you're a very fixed for example, because of the way

Stuart  
a person is like

Carolyn  
I do not study humans, I should make that clear. Um, I don't know if I can answer. Yeah, but um, yeah, so basically, you know, looking at aquatic organisms at the, you know, at different levels of the food chain, there's not a slam dunk answer that plastics are bad. There's they are definitely being consumed. In particular cases, they are potentially modifying behavior or causing you know, that other That you're not eating as much other food or things like that. Or maybe you're being confused by a pellet and going for the plastic instead of for the real foods. So you may be not that nutritionally awesome for anything that wants to eat you. Right?

Stuart  
So it could reduce fitness in a way that it's hard to measure, though.

Carolyn  
Right? Exactly, especially when you consider how many other stressors are acting on them all the time. Yeah.

Stuart  
So is that stuff that they're researching? Is that something we're going to get like an answer to that kind of question, or is it just going to be vague? And we don't know because of a "science is hard" type of thing.

Carolyn  
There are a lot of people looking at this, that all over the world there are large groups of people who are trying to understand this, and whether or not you know, the issue of microplastics being consumed is really a problem and it seems like it is a problem. it's more likely that like stuff biofilms growing On the

Stuart  
Pretend I have no idea what a biofilm is. Because I don't.

Sarah  
I would just say that it's it's more about, like the fact that these plastics could be changing the types of organisms that make up the very, very base of the food chain. Yeah, right, Carolyn. So like the algae and the things like the, I don't know, for lack of a better word, like the scum that's alive in bodies of water. Like those things live on microplastics. They can live on microplastics. There's a study done by some folks at Loyola University that showed that like the, the stuff that was living on the microplastics coming out of wastewater treatment plants included stuff like ecola, like stuff that should have been killed in the treatment process was actually making its way through because it was living on the microplastics that we're getting through. So like it can kind of fundamentally change those things. That kind of what you're getting at Carolyn?

Carolyn  
Yeah, and I think so we should note that in no way do we think that algae are actual scum

Sarah  
yes. I'm just trying to be a general and colloquial as possible. Right.

Stuart  
I actually have a lot of good friends who are algae.

Carolyn  
But yeah, and I think that's, I think that the story, and this story is far from complete. But the story with microplastics is not necessarily the plastic itself is a problem is that the plat..., the fact that the plastic is there is causing changes that can potentially have huge ramifications throughout the food web, including all the way humans.

Stuart  
Yeah. And it sounds like we don't even necessarily know that timeline like that can be something in a near term timeline or could be something that we'd have to look back in 5000 years, which I'm unlikely to do, frankly, but we'd have to look back, you know, many, many, many generations down the line to see that it was a problem. Does that seem fair to say?

Hope  
Yes, I think so. I keep going back to this idea of the fish eating the plastics from the scum or algae or whatever you want to call it. And then we eat the fish. And so one big thing that I know is that the FDA suggests that everybody eats fish twice per week to get those yummy, delicious nutrients that we need to stay healthy. So one question I have when thinking about choosing which fish to buy is like is this may be something that would affect wild fish more than say, like fish that have been farmed through agriculture with high quality water systems, or our wild caught in our culture fish basically exposed to the same levels of microplastics?

Sarah  
That is a fantastic question that I don't have an answer for.

Carolyn  
Yeah, I don't think we have an answer for that. And the other thing adding to that is even if you don't look at something like that, like agriculture versus wild, different species affected very differently. So it may be that some are you know better at processing things and kicking them out. It may be that some organisms at the very base are more likely to go after plastics or learn to avoid them. And that is something where getting back to Stuart's science is hard, it's you doing these experiments is a ton of work like keeping the organisms alive, keeping everything exactly the same except for you know, exposing them to plastic or not exposing them to microfibers gets way harder. Like, of the studies we looked at. There were very, very few that actually looked at micro fibers because like microbeads, you can order micro fibers. One of the ways they made a microfiber was they took like polypropylene line like that yellow line, and they just sort of hacked at it to get little tiny pieces of plastic and that's what they exposed their arms to. So So, it's like, you know, so I think your your question hope about like, you know, could it be agriculture or wild? You could even ask Are there certain species because that's what happens with other contaminants, right that like, you know that certain species tend to bio accumulate, which means the sort of get a bunch of contaminants in their tissues. certain species bio accumulate more than others because of the way their internal metabolism works. So do we know which species of fish take in more plastic at this point, or it's still just ongoing research? I think it's been ongoing research. But Sarah, go ahead.

Sarah  
There was some there was some work done at Loyola that looked at fish consumption and invertebrate consumption of microplastics and wild caught fish not you know, not looking at agriculture, but and they found that the and they didn't have a huge number of species. You know, again, these are hard. That's a really great point, Carolyn, these are really hard studies to conduct. So oftentimes, you're really limited in what you can do. So they caught, you know, kind of smaller fish. But what what they tended to see was that the fish that were eating things that had higher microplastics loads, had more microplastics in their guts. So, in particular, they were looking at like round gobies, round gobies, I think were the number one fish that they caught. And these were in Great Lakes tributaries, and round gobies had the most microplastics in their guts. And that's probably because they're consuming things like zebra mussels, which are filter feeding and taking in those micro fibers and taking in those microplastics at a higher rate than something that's eating you know, an invertebrate or larval fish or you know, something that doesn't just constantly filter water. What what that means, though, in terms of like, the plastics in their guts, because we're obviously we're not eating fish guts. So, so in terms of the plastics moving, like from the gut into the tissue, I think there's a lot of questions there that are lap.

Stuart  
This is really interesting. It sounds like there are a lot of questions and a lot of ongoing research, some of which we funded. And now I think a lot of which is being funded, you know, by even bigger organizations, and we are, but so so we have some questions. But so what do we know about microplastics? We know that they come from almost any plastic we use, right? There are a lot with our clothes. We know that they get into the environment, and they some of them accumulate on the sediment. And then we don't know what happens to that over the long term. Some of it stays in the water column where it gets eaten, and it can go up the food chain, right.

Sarah  
Yeah. Yeah, that's a great point.

Stuart  
So my long-term business plan of selling goby dogs in the Chicago region I got to...

Sarah  
do some research.

Stuart  
Yeah, well, no, this is my big idea because the goby is like roughly hot dog shaped right. And Chicago loves their hotdogs. So, so this was my big plan was to cook gobies and put them in like hotdog buns with, you know, the pickles and the peppers and stuff and the celery, also. Yeah, and then saw those on the streets of Chicago. But now I...

Sarah  
gotta make sure they're kosher.

Hope  
So moving on from Stuart's crazy idea. So what's being done about these microplastics then I know that some people that I'm familiar with, but they're all in the natural resources world already. And so they're very conscientious of these things. They're trying to not buy polyester and not buy fleece, and choose cotton and linen instead. But like you mentioned earlier, Sarah, that a lot of microplastics, were coming from microbeads and face washes. And I know that some of those now or maybe all of them are illegal. And so what else is being done? What are people about this problem,

Sarah  
and microplastics is really kind of a tricky problem, because first of all, it's a global issue, right? Like, the stuff that's getting into the ocean moves around the stuff that ends up in the Great Lakes and in our rivers, you know, it moves. I mean, this the stuff that doesn't end up in the sediments and stay put, I guess. But yeah, I mean, it's a very interconnected issue. And there's no like, quick band aid for it, like how do you get fibers out of, of, you know, natural waters, short of filtering them with like a very, very small filter. I mean, I don't know how you do it. So. So like you were saying, like, a lot of personal responsibility kind of comes into it like this is an issue that you care about. But I think taking a look at your behaviors and you know, your consumer habits and, and things like that are, are a great way to maybe not solve the problem, but at least ensure that you're not continuing Going to contribute to the problem? Because Yeah, it's it's tricky. Whenever I give a talk about microplastics. That's what people want to hear, right? Well, how do I help? How do I help? And I'm not sure that the answers are super satisfying.

Hope  
What answers do you normally give?

Sarah  
Normally, I tell people like one of them... you know, what you said is it you can start switching to wearing natural fibers, natural fiber clothing. And that is a lot harder than it sounds.

Hope  
So what do you say go to natural fiber clothing? Is that saying like go to 90% or more, that's cotton, or do we want to go like full 100% cotton? Whoo, that's, like if we make smaller changes, and then we eventually move to that 100% does that help?

Sarah  
Yeah, I'm a big fan of like the incremental changes, right? Because making these big changes, like, you know, sort of like in a wholesale fashion all at once. It's really hard for people and people tend to not stick with those kinds of changes. So yeah, I'm a big proponent of like, every little bit you can do is fantastic. So, you know, even if it's as simple as not buying plastic water bottles anymore drinking tap water using a reusable bottle, and we kind of harp on that, like it's harped on I think a lot. But like these big pieces of plastic also turn into smaller pieces of plastic a lot of the times, right, so reusable water bottles, not using like Ziploc bags and you know, plastic grocery bags and bringing reusable bags and reusable silverware i think is a great one. Like there's no reason not to bring a fork from home to your lunch instead of using a plastic fork. You know, things like that, I think are really small changes that people can make but they create good habits.

Stuart  
So Sarah, where should people go to find out more about you or follow you on social media or whatever where should they go. So

Sarah  
we have a We have a Twitter it's at GreatLakesP2, with P2 standing for Pollution Prevention. And you know hope does a fantastic job of trying to share like information on the Sea Grant Facebook page and the Sea Grant Instagram page. And yeah, I mean but I can always also be reached through email and my contact informations on the Illinois Indiana Sea Grant webpage at iiseagrant.org.

Stuart  
Fantastic. And so Carolyn, thanks for all this interesting information. If people want to find out more about the research that's been done in your meta analysis and other things, where can they go?

Carolyn  
So you're going to want to learn about some research the Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant is doing and has funded because we have a lot of some of the best microplastic researchers are right here in Illinois and Indiana, especially at Loyola University, but they can visit The research database at iiseagrant.org. Under research and research projects, you can search topics like microplastics or other contaminants to and see what we funded. There's also a lot of microplastics research going on right now, you'll see a lot of studies stories where people are saying we don't necessarily know what's happening. But there are few who are really trying to dig in and say, you know, what are the actual effects long term, if you look for things that are like meta analysis, or kind of an overarching review that has some kind of analysis in it, those ones are pretty great.

Stuart  
Excellent. Sarah and Carolyn, thank you very much for teaching me about the Great Lakes.

Hope  
Me too.

Stuart  
Well, that was a really interesting interview and a really interesting first episode, I'm excited to see where we go over the next few months as people teach me about the Great Lakes. Hope what is something that you learned about the Great Lakes today?

Hope  
I learned that gobies should not be made it too hotdogs and that a lot of fish in the Great Lakes feed off of things on the bottom and there are a lot of microplastics down there. So we should all work on using less plastic.

Stuart  
I would first like to point out that don't knock a gobydog until you try one.

Today, I learned that with microplastics. There's still a lot of questions that we have, and it seems like the kind of thing that isn't going away and so it's really worth investigating these questions, and I'm excited to see where that research goes. Well hope where can people find you on social media?

Hope  
You can follow Illinois, Indiana Sea Grant at ilinseagrant. We're on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram and if you really want to follow me personally I don't know why you would I my handle is @hopekyra.

Stuart  
Thank you so much hope and instead of following me just go to iiseagrant.org and check out all the great work we do, and we'll see you next month.
